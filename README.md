## Gravilog Company Website Home Page
* Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my internship at Gravilog. The goal was to design and develop a home page for the company website from the ground up using modern web development technologies. The homepage is designed with a calming, user-friendly interface, showcasing the company's services and products in a clean and organized layout.

* Features
1. Modern and Calming Design
    Non-bright colors and gradient effects were used throughout the page to create a calming user experience and avoid visual strain.

2. Carousel for Service Showcase
    A carousel is implemented to showcase the various services offered by the company, providing users with a smooth navigation experience through the offerings.

3. Card Layout for Content Organization
    The layout of the page is styled using cards to organize information and services into neat sections, improving readability and user engagement.

4. Ribbon for Premium Subscription
    A ribbon is used to advertise the company’s premium subscription service, drawing attention without overwhelming the user.

5. AI-generated Unique Images
    The cards and other visual elements of the page feature unique images created using AI tools, adding an original and modern feel to the overall design.

* Technologies Used

    HTML5: For structuring the content of the website.
    CSS3: For styling the layout, applying gradient effects, and making the page visually appealing.
    JavaScript (JS): For interactive elements and functionality like the carousel.
